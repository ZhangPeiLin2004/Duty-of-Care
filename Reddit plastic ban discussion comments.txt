Comment: It's a first step. Yes if I were in charge you would need a special permit to make nearly anything out of plastic. There would only be exceptions for medical, science, etc. Every product that could be made with alternative substances would be required to be made that way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I createda wikito help folks be the most effective climate advocates they can be, focused onwhat we most need to do to solve the problem.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Well its the consumers that are to blame. We are so greedy. How dare you even suggest that mega corporations should have to make changes. They are the ones putting a can of beans and 3 baby carrots on your plate. They are the ones that continue to sell you the same gas at a 30% increase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I’d just outright ban bottled water in grocery stores, except in areas where the municipal water quality is low. I’d also add a big tax on plastic bottled water (everywhere else its sold) that directly funds fixing the water supply issue in those areas with poor water quality. Canned water in situations where you have to buy water are fine, and other canned drink products are fine, since aluminum recycling actually works.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This has been my impression since many cities in the United States did the same thing. It's performative politics used to placate the people passionate about environmentalism.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Came here to say this^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The real switch should be towards reusables. They are not even talking about it. :( Industries will just produce more of the same thing in other materials. We’ll end up with the same pile of garbage on the beach, just made of bamboo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Plastic waste isn't even 1% of the problem. It's mostly industries. And overfishing (Seaspiracy is on Netflix).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: they're banning plastic bags and straws.  who do you think supplies those things, if not corporations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The biggest culprit & too often omitted :Wars.   In terms of scale, everything pales in comparaison:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: At the moment, it's also fishing nets (Seaspiracy, Netflix)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: 5% reduction in waste production by forbidding useless items is a pretty good deal.

Comment: Whataboutism

Comment: Well, finally somebody is doing something.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Fuck yeah!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How about giving up on the tar sands industry instead ? Much bigger impact than single plastic use, best would be both.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yeah but to me that doesn't say 'its bad to ban plastics" it says we should do better at providing actual good alternatives because now they aren't that great..  but a lot of people look at that title and think whelp let's not do anything at all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It causes environmental pollution which does change ecosystems. Climate change isn't just global warming (which plastic/petroleum does also impact).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The manufacture of it involves consuming significant quantities of fossil fuels, which do in fact cause warming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: No.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They're made from what oozes out of a rubber tree
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We never banned plastics. Instead we were given the option to use "reusable" plastic bags that are thicker. We had two options to vote for, and we voted in the one that favored the oil company. It's all rather silly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They're not included in the ban.

Comment: Uh oh .. but wha bou condoms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: But the straws. I don't see why we can't find a reasonable trade off.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The only single use plastics that should be banned ire those fucking hard shell plastic things that electronics, toys, etc come in. I don't use straws anyway, but leave my fucking plastic bags alone. In fact, I want the real plastic ones from the 80s/90s to return instead of the cheap cellophane shit we have now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: damn this gonna be so helpful!!!! /s
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They gone make you eat the food at the grocery store next 🤑🤑🤑🤑
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Neat thought, but some single use plastics REDUCE carbon emissions. Specifically single use plastics involving food. Fun fact of the day: You know how you see plastic wrapped cucumbers in stores and think "That seems wasteful"? The amount of plastic used to wrap that cucumber actually SIGNIFICANTLY offsets carbon emissions, as it significantly reduces food waste by making sure it lasts significantly longer before going bad. And as it turns out, food waste produces a STUPID amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, from the rot itself to the infrastructure around keeping everything stocked to the infrastructure around hauling more waste garbage(and the inevitable plastic containers used to pack that garbage out), the significant rise in co2 created in the farming process, the machines, et cetera.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The ban covers a specific list of items, and your cucumber wrapper is not on it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What's going to happen to indigenous communities that are forced to buy clean water (in single use plastics) because there's no safe reserve water? I'm all for sustainability but we need to consider knock off affects of this change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Ooh! Are they going to do the thing that every other place banning single-used plastics has done, where stores now give out "reusable" bags for a small fee that contain more plastic but get thrown away after one use anyway? Super!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: banning plastic packaging will in factincreasecarbon emissions as few other materials are so lightweight and hence transporting them will for sure burn far more fuel, and food that is wrapped in plastic lasts far longer, which means there are tons less emissions from food wastage, a major contributor. solving plastic pollution and solving climate change stemming from carbon emissions are very much opposing goals, but modern environmentalism, never mind this sub, is not ready for that much nuance. oh well, maybe another 20 years this will get into the public consciousness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How about we try to fix some bigger issues first?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Too little too late. We're fucked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Broadly, this is a tiny piece ofwhat needs to happen in the next few years.  And that's ok: no single action is enough.  What matters is that we do all of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Typical liberal Canada ban things out right and have zero substitutions for the old method lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yeah uh, a bit late on that We are beyond fucked with the amount of plastic in the ocean
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What about all of those single use masks they were demanding everyone wear for the past two years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What about greenhouse gas emission, deforestation, cow farming, and the millions of other things
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Glad I don't still need to use condoms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: You're about the 13th person to bring up condoms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This is all a political stunt. A majority of all plastic in the oceans comes from a handful of 3rd world under developed countries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: FYI latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: maybe somebody should let india know about this too, they have rivers so full of plastic you can walk across them. i do feel bad tho that plastic from our canadian landfills magically flew away and into the oceans, choking plankton and whatnot. i mean, what other sources could there possibly be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Imagine all the masks, PCR tests and the packaging of those items added up. Look at the medical equipment needed for diabetics. The government needs to start finding physical and health education. At least I can reuse a grocery bag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Does that mean they’re banning condoms? Lmao
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Trudeau and his ideals… give me a break
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Condoms?🤔
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Good luck to the medical field. More than half the stuff they use has to be thrown away immediately after first use due to cleanliness/sterility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I see cardboard pregnancy tests being problematic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: But in true capitalist form they will never attack the true causes of climate change but stick to the attack on individuals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So we can save the ocean from mask pollution? Awesome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: And they  end up using reusable plastic has a single use plastic, so it doesnt change shit and might even be worse since its a ''stronger'' type of plastic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So now all the heavy duty reusable plastics get thrown in the ocean.  Way to go, Canada.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Fucking stupid.  Put it on the consumers.  How about focus on food packaging instead - like the dumbass new trend of wrapping 4-5 spicy peppers in a pile of plastic, on a plastic tray and charging double the bulk price.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How about the one billion plastic covid self test kits we ordered because they got the hypochondriacs addicted to using them everytime they got the sniffles?  But straws are the problem here...

Comment: Paper can not do all the jobs of plastics yet.  It's so annoying when your Uber Eats paper bag fails from the steam and your dinner ends up spilt on the floor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: FYI, We in Canada have one of the worst GHG and pollution outputs per person in the entire world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Double use plastics here we come
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Single use plastic? I didn’t even know that was a thing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Same old trick. We all know that private jets are way worse. Ban it first, then we're talking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Are they moving towards waterless detergent in paper packaging then?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This seems progressive, but the Catholic Church has tried to ban single use plastics for YEARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: dope
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: While I support it, I'm curious how everyone would plan to compensate. Like, this fundamentally changes a lot of industries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: From a country that has already had plastic bags banned for a couple of years, the main benefits are less waste and most importantly less plastic bags just flying around. Especially around roads they look so much cleaner these days than before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Next target: medical waste.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: You’re getting distracted again. Canada has the tar sands which are aggressively spreading outward with the help of foreign donations. Remember you are not the problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Too little, too late! More serious changes are needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Back to all glass and washing tubes in hospitals I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: 90% of ocean plastic pollution comes from commercial/industrial fishing. 10% comes from consumer end single-use plastics. We are only appearing to combat climate change by doing what we do best...going after the little guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: But still polutes the water of my country, Mexico withtheir fuckn mines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Good thing we have tons of forests here in Canada for the paper straws, cardboard containers and wooden cutlery!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What about cars
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They need to be making things like this out of hemp, and the conservatives should be the 1st ones advocating it. 🙄
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: That’s great and all, but I’m pretty sure we are to late. We need a Thanos.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Europe banned straws a while back. It’s pathetic political Theater. Looking at the beaches and mountain ranges in Greece, I’m not shocked by all the straws I see everywhere but by everything else. Water bottles, whole trash bags full of household junk, cans, masks etc. if you want to get rid of plastic… tax it 1000% at the point of sale. And give people money back for returning waste properly. Then watch the pollution disappear. We need to make essentially all plastic a substance that costs more to keep/dispose in natures than to return to a recycling plant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Banning plastic bags is a joke. We banned them in Cali. Safeway now replaced their plastic bags with these thick plastic reusable ones, that no one ever re uses and can't be recycled out here....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It's my opinion that there are bigger fish to fry than these specific "single use" plastics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Paywall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Good now tax the corporations for their part in global warming that’s more important than individual consumers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We can always count on our government to take appropriate half-measures to make it look like they're serious about solving problems that were identified decades ago.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: again or still?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I thought plastic grocery bags were actually less harmful for the environment than the alternatives when you consider pollution from production
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: And then we decided to ban condoms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yet my mailbox is flooded with wasted paper every week...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Worrying given that many of the alternatives are much worse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It’s sad to see people come through this thread and downvote people providing data and information on why this isn’t the perfect solution. If you don’t come with an open mind to sustainable solutions and look at the pros and cons how are we going to make any progress towards a sustainable future?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canada isn't the problem. Go to China, India, Malaysia and stop those places from throwing plastic into the ocean.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: For those saying it's a political stunt, Canada and certain provinces were also leading the way on banning plastic bags from grocery stores. Is it possible that they are just a more progressive country when it comes to waste reduction? Yes they virtue signal a lot, but better that than just mindlessly continue to destroy the planet. I applaud the effort and maybe other countries can follow suit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Ehh.. no worries, we still double bag each two liter down here in the US.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Good! Stopped buying things like individually wrapped anything. But sometimes I look at the waste from a home cooked meal and it’s still obscene.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Please America do the right thing!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We outsource our problems overseas.  Nothing to see here…
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The next step is to get rid of single use condoms, which are the real environment killer. I've already convinced the wife that rinsing them out is perfectly safe, now I just have to get her sister on board too and I'm golden 👌
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So what are condoms gonna be wrapped in then?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Thank goodness my disposable face mask doesn't have any plastics in it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I hope they’re careful with their definition of “single use plastics.” We did the same thing here in Washington State, but all the businesses evaded the rule by making their plastic bags slightly thicker, but they’re certainly still single use bags for all intents and purposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: At least we know who can't do anything about climate change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: And what about styrofoam? Have we just forgotten about that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comment: Good thing Germany is doing their part in offsetting this by reopening those coal plants lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Doesn’t matter what they do Canada is always going to be dumb.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: plastics arent the cause of climate change.  they are pollution and can be bad for the environment, but plastic itself is ironically sequestered carbon, which is the goal of many CO2 emission reversal plans.

Comment: Hippies legalize weed...weed industry immediately creates more single use plastic for pre-rollies and all the other shit... Hippies ban single use plastic and revert to Bong.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They are replacing single use plastics with pulp-based products.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: real question: what do you do for sustainable straws? cause paper straws become useless in about 30 seconds after touching the drink
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: But in CA grocery stores we use heavy duty plastic bags that arent single use. But everyone still uses them as if they are single use. So is that really better? I feel like that has more production cost and waste in the long run. And wouldn’t that take longer to decompose. Why not use biodegrade?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Next Canada needs to stop exporting their trash into US landfills.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I got takeout last week from a restaurant and all the containers were high quality metal and silicone construction. They belonged tothis company. We washed them out when we were done and dropped them off at a drop location at a store two blocks from our house. There was no $$ deposit, but we were disincentivized from keeping them as the silicone lids had small holes and weren’t great for storing the food. We didn’t have to throw out takeout containers and I liked the fact my food was touching metal and silicone and not plastic. It was an easy and positive experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How about you give us some alternatives like biodegradable plastics? Here in bc we have a mandatory .25 charge that just goes to the retailer. Even on non-plastic take out paper bags. It is ridiculous.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How are you combating climate change with this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So are condoms on the list ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: If the US only contributes like 0.3% of plastic pollution, Canada has got to contribute like 0.0000003%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This is way better than Colorado's dumb fucking idea to charge .10 per plastic bag!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: That's cool and all, but can they do something about these useless cardboard straws we get for drinks now? They basically disintegrate halfway through my drink. I can't even finish a frappucino from Starbucks because my straw just won't stay as a straw for longer than 15 mins. And I drink slowly. I have to ask for 2-3 straws for 1 drink so that I can actually, y'know, drink the whole thing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I never understood how banning plastic helps climate change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: No water bottles?  Glass bottles instead?  I'm curious about the water bottles, it appears a recycling initiative might be considered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yes target consumers to make sure they dont ask for real changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: ITT: People are the absolute worst.

Comment: Isn't it like fishing nets that make up a lot of the plastic and pollution in the oceans?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Fishing nets are a problemtoo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Condoms? 🤔
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This includes condoms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I feel like people don't seem to realize this will also add to inflation, hurting the majority of people purchasing these items. I think it's a good idea, just a bad time to implement this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This is to combat pollution, not climate change. Paper straws and bags have a larger carbon footprint than their plastic counterparts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Ban plastics so people don't get upset we're destroying the Greenbelt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Based
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Great! The USA is promising 2032. What is China, India, and Indonesia doing? They’re the most populated countries and they need to climb on board. Our biggest enemy of the plastics will be lobbyists for the big oil who are the major producers of plastics. We need to stop politicians from protecting them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Companies make shit out of plastic cause its cheap to produce, and breaks down quickly, forcing you to buy the product a second again. We should be making stuff out of metal/wood/nonplastics more often and selling the commodity portion separate like we used to 60 years ago. Eg, buying standard razor blades with your nice shaving razor instead of using disposables, or like those EU grocery stores that let you fill up your own container full of shampoo, detergent, coffee  beans, beer, etc. Its not only a change for the companies, but a change that has to be accepted by the populace in order to get real results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Encourage Coke/Pepsi to recycle by making the  soda bottles too expensive to sell until they recycle the bottles themselves.  The Corps are not going to care until it hits their bottom line so hard they can't say no any longer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: they didn't give us any heads up either.. fucking had to pile seperate articles of my food in my car like an idiot... bought a few of those Walmart multiple use bags and threw em right in the river outnof spite.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Eliminate plastic packaging over things already packaged in fucking plastic!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So this includes disposable masks, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Why not just ban sale of plastic product if another material can be used? For exemple, some of my knife have a plastic handle, why not use a metal or wood one?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What about disposable vapes that everyone seems to use nowadays ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Wait does this include chips bags?

Comment: This is gonna suck for me, now I have to figure out what to do with my cat poop, cuz I just used the plastic bags from the grocery store
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They also just approved a massive offshore oil project on the east coast. They say it’s ok tho because they say somehow the millions of barrels of oil they will be pumping up will somehow be carbon neutral by 2050? Amazing!

Comment: Yesterday I needed a piece of hard plastic with a hole in it. I used a plastic cap from an empty spray paint can and drilled into it. The plastic ribboned off and particulated into tiny tiny pieces all over the place, causing so much debris it was insane. Poor little critters be mistaking that for food and eating stuff that'll tear up their little bellies. Insane.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Here's the secret about plastics that they don't tell you. You can not recycle plastics. Look closely at any plastic item. See that little triangle symbol? That indicates the grade of plastic and can also tell you about the safety and uses of that item. Most of them cannot be mixed, so dumping them all together and melting them down results in a slurry of useless crap.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Maybe we should work on making single-use Plastics reusable like a recyclable bag we put a man on the moon but we can't make a recyclable bag or black plastic that can also be recycled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Does this apply to condoms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: unless it's a garbage or recycling bag
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Can’t we go back to glass bottles for everything?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Why don't we ever go after China, where all this shit is being produced in massive quantities? The manufacturing industry in China is polluting our planet with all kinds of chemicals and stuff, way more than NA consumers are. They need strict regulations and we need to stop buying so many products
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Thanks I am cured
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Lolol. Fucking terrible idea. You can make a billion plastic grocery bags for less energy than making a million cloth bags. Will you get 1000 uses out of your cloth bag begore it rips?

Comment: Thanks, but it's already past my blood brain barrier.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Too bad paper straws are fucking garbage, spend some money on r&d for something less shit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I also would like for businesses to be required to make ALL plastic recyclable or they can not sell it.   Also with supermarkets. What ever they sell must be recycled in some say not just throwing it in the garbage!

Comment: A little late…
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Does that include condoms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So this may be averystupid question, but what will happen to those giant bags of popsicles you can buy at grocery stores? Will they come in different packaging? If so, what would it be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They're banning a limited list of single-used plastics.  This isn't a banned item.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Plastic straws are a medical device.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This is greenwashing at its worst. It’s been proven that grocery stores that get rid of single use plastic bags are a detriment for the environment. A reusable bag takes almost 200x the carbon to create than a single use plastic bag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The forest industry in Canada alone matches the put out of every vehicle in Canada, and that is just one industry in Canada. I don’t understand the bags and straws. Very much like the electric car conundrum.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Oregon banned plastic bags in grocery stores. All the grocery stores replaced their plastic bags with... thicker plastic bags.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I don't understand people calling grocery bags single-use.  They are used for so much in my household and only make it to my garbage, as a garbage bag, the grocery bag's final form.   Reuse is supposed be promoted but now it looks like I'll have to buy single use garbage bags just to throw them out WHICH MAKES NO SENSE.    About a decade ago my local grocery store allegedly switched to biodegradable plastic grocery bags - I assumed they weren't lying about this.   Why isn't that the way to go?  and why does that have to stop?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Remarkably few people reuse bags in the way you describe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Condoms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Latex isn't a plastic, and condoms and their wrappers aren't on the list of banned items.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Single use plastics are often less carbon intensive to produce than paper products so we should be a bit skeptical that this is all good as it comes to climate change. Glass bottles are far worse than plastic bottles, aluminum is quite energy intensive as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canada is obsessed with restaurants.

Comment: I mean, sure, this helps, but to do this and ignore the tar sands or companies that pollute and far out-pollute what any consumer or every consumer can do, doesn't really help that much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Every step in the right direction is a good one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yay! Maybe America will wake up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Wow amazing let’s fuck the every day man and do nothing to address the fact it’s corporations fucking everything up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I read I think starting next year either the UK or EU. Are going to make plastic soda bottle makers and soda companies. Make the caps stay with the bottles. To combat plastic litter,/ pollution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I'm kinda miffed about the cutlery thing, I buy plastic spoons en-mass for paint-testing while painting models and I haven't really found anything else that's as readily available and gives as good an idea what a paint combination is going to look like. :(I'm gonna have to buy tonnes of them to stock up lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: YES! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: My stoned ass read they were burning them, I was like tha fuck??? 😂😂😂😂
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Uh... anything can be single use lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We got a lot of "great but change everything instead" in the comments on this one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: LOl if anybody buys that this will impact anything at all, never mind climate change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We all need to switch to hemp plastic for single use at least
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: If it's like WA state the grocery chains will just make even thicker asyic bags and call them reusable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Bit late to the game, but it's a welcome move. Now enforcement is the issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: People don’t realize how much single use plastic is used for structural support to lighten products to use less fuel for transport.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Ok now ban plastic fishing nets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This could help….. like 40 years ago lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I'm from Alberta where we have the oil sands. This doesn't really fix all that much I don't think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Greenwashing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canada is #1! yay!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Does Ontario still use milk in plastic bags and how’s that going to change?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Is it too late?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Most fossil fuels are still in the ground.  There are forests yet standing.  We can choose to leave them there, starting withthese steps.  If we do, and bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero,the climate will stabilize.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: But they won’t put a stop to plastic starting from the corporation. This type of lazy pushing consumers to use less plastics is lame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Do condoms count
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: You're about the 11th person to ask.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: There's another positive to this in terms of economics: removing single use plastics reduces demand for oil. Lower demand for oil reduces costs of fuel, and encourages oil companies to refine more to make up for their losses. This is just a guess, btw, so please correct or support my stance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Stabilizing the climate means leaving the oil in the ground.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Thanks, Canada.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Uplifting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Cool, now go after industry where the bulk of the issue actually is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Corporations create the most waste, plastic is used to make a greater profit, be prepared to pay more for everything!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Why is all climate change action targeted at population at large and not industries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: A lot is targeted at industry - things like electric vehicle sales requirements, and changes to electric generation.  You don't hear about it as much though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It's theconsumersfault, not theproducers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: In Australia our shopping bags now say reusable on them. Ta daa, not single use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How much will it reduce emissions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Just a little.  No one measure is enough.Do them all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I use the 5cent grocery plastic bags for my kitchen compost bin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Great, while china will continue dumping millions of tons into the ocean, and while they'll continue polluting with their coal plants. Why is the west going so far to stop climate change while we let other countries do anything they want?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I wonder how it will change the lives of the 3 people that live there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How about the fishing industry and their nets they discard in the ocean ? What have we become :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Has anyone checked if this includes condoms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It does not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Cap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Did this a few years ago in Australia saving our 2 major supermarkets hundred of millions of dollars a year. Pretty sure they didn't have to spend a dime of that saved money to help combat climate change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Latex is made from tree sap and condom  packaging is not covered
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: What we need is another discovery. Just like plastics were discovered, but instead something that doesn't harm the environment and is cheap to make. Then industries will convert.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Wholesome Canada Moment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: The world needs to do this now !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So.... You guys going to get reusable condoms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree, and is not a plastic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: How does this help with climate change?  Less trash is a good thing, but I don't see how it really effects the climate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Plastics are made from fossil fuels, and a lot are burned in the process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Which is great, I agree, however, can we please use plant based straws instead of paper. They suck!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Should ban single use latex.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: FYI latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree.  No real reason to ban it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Fun fact about 50% of ocean plastic is fishing nets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Love the idea for the plant but also love to complain…
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I have to buy garbage bags because I can’t reuse my plastic grocery bags now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Why does my life have to get shittier, when corporations are responsible for the majority of waste and pollution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They have power.  You don't.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This will make meaningful difference
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Do they have fewer corporate loopholes than in the US? Because if this happened in the US guaranteed the only ones who'd really have to follow this are the small companies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They banned a specific list of items.  Those are not on the list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Climate change is destroyed the end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canada is gonna ask us to build a wall & pay for it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: We need to get rid of the excessive amount of packaging with weed products.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Stop having babies.  Give the world back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I think all this is great. Who can argue about cutting down on waste and reducing pollution?  I realize that we all are guilty of overusing plastic etc. However I do find it interesting that the emphasis and blame seems to be solely on the end user/consumer. Companies that create products such as refrigerators, freezers and TVs, full of plastic which are designed to fail or are difficult to repair are not called out on this enough. There are, in North America, junk yards filled with broken dishwashers, stoves, refrigerators etc. It’s too expensive to recycle these items, you have pay someone separate the metal from the plastic - very costly. But god forbid the consumer who uses a plastic straw or bag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They did this in Portland Oregon and it worked for a couple days and then the plastic bag companies made the bags a bit thicker and thicker plastics count as multi use so they just got around it and nothing changed. It was pretty sad :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: If you think Canada will touch bottled water or soda, you have no idea how politicians get paid.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Honestly, I'd say about half of the plastic waste there is in the world comes from the legal weed packaging here. Every time I buy a vape cart, a penguin dies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Recycled plastic is generally lower quality. On most things it probably doesn't make a difference but on some it definitely will.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canadian here. Love putting the new cardboard McDonald's straws into the same ol' fully plastic lids. Big brain moves here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Am I an idiot? I can’t figure out how they’re going to get around just outright not having plastic cutlery or cigarette filters? What are the alternatives for these?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Wooden cutlery and quitting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It's not plastic, but I wonder how many trees would be saved by banning junk mail, on top of all of the factors that go into its creation and delivery.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Next we need to ban individual means of transportation and start investing in mass transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Yes but they have tar oil sands production for fuel and pollution 😂 and one of the worst environmental mining consortium of companies in the world. But get rid of the single use plastic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So long tampon applicators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Wow just an year after the EU did this? I think modern countries would be on pace at least on this simple thing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Paper straws suck.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Canada already sucks as is with regards to waste and recycling management. Do something about that first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Does this include condoms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Is there a eco-friendly way to recycle plastic?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I do enjoy bamboo utensils. They snap way less then the plastic ones
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I just smile and hand you a Vegemite sandwich.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Lol I read it as "burning"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: No more condoms???
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This just in, America doubling plastic use to combat progress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Plastic bags need to be banned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Hallo EU please take notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It should be mandatory for companies to take care of their brand of trash. Watch what P&G does…
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Bullshit, the federal government sells their weed in humongous single use plastic containers! This is a shipping nightmare wasting fuel and the plastic ends up in the landfill.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: This is a very good idea. Hope all turns out well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Kinda wanna see disposable ecigs next. Disposing of li-ion batteries left and right with nicotine residue cannot be good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: I wonder if hospitals are going to be getting rid of single use plastics and going back to glass rubber and metal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: They even got rid of the tiny little plastic bread 'ties'. The entire bread bag is still plastic and we have 'single-use' plastics on almost every food product that wont ever be recycled. But its nice to see something happening.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Can we please can yogurt cups? The individual ones? There is no need for those seriously
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Is reusable plastic cutlery excempt (as in still allowed)? Im all for banning single use items - however I've always used plastic cutlery, even at home as I don't like metal and the wooden types are just weird. I just get better quality plastic cutlery, wash it after use and on average get at least 6months of use out of each item before they break.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: It's a narrow list of specific single-use items.  Reusable plastic cutlery is not on the list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Mining is a way bigger concern for Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Because it's a relatively expensive way to produce hydrogen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: Because it's a better option to not produce plastic in the first place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: So long as it's coming from fossil fuels, that's just another way to extract and burn fossil fuels, and increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment: have they considered the necessity of plastic straws for immuno-compromised individuals? some people require a single-use plastic straw and risk having a reusable one build up bacteria over the day, getting them sick. it’s the same concept as the necessity for plastic in medical equipment for the same reason.
