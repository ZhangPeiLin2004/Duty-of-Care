# PFAS Toolbox

A static, English-language website for browsing and exploring PFAS substances with advanced filtering and detailed views integrating PBT assessment, CLP classification, functions, alternatives with change in functionality, and market uptake.

## Getting Started
1. Unzip the project and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Ensure the `data/`, `css/`, and `images/` folders remain alongside the HTML files.

## Usage
- **Filter** on left: Search, Use Category, Sub-Use, Applications, PBT Assessment, CLP Classification.
- **Cards** display PBT badges and CLP codes.
- Click **View Details** to open `substance.html?cas=...`.

## Customization
- Add icons to `images/ghs/` for each CLP code (lowercase filenames, e.g. `h350.svg`).
- Update JSON data in `data/` as needed.

## Deployment
- Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages on the `main` branch.
