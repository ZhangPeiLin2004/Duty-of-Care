          <h1>Duty of Care</h1>
        </section>
    

    
    <section id="entail" class="section">
        <h2>What does Duty of Care entail?</h2>
        <p>Promoting cleaner, safer practices isn’t just ethical—it’s increasingly required by law. 
        “Duty of care” refers to the responsibility that companies, governments, and individuals have to prevent environmental harm and reduce health risks. 
        This principle is central to European and international law and applies directly to PFAS use and pollution. Here's how your company can meet its duty of care obligations, structured around clear action categories:</p>
    
            <div class="step">
            <h3>1. Integrate into Operations</h3>
            <p><b> You are expected to incorporate environmental and human health considerations across your entire value chain.</b> This means embedding responsibility for reducing harm—like PFAS pollution—into company policies and practices from top to bottom.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Context:</strong> The Dutch Omgevingswet (Article 1.6) imposes a general duty on everyone to care for the physical environment. This reflects a shift toward “outsourced law,” where compliance is shaped by companies as much as legislators. Businesses are co-authors of environmental governance and must internalize sustainability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
            <h3>2. Identify and Assess</h3>
            <p><b> Businesses are obligated to identify risks their activities pose to the environment,</b> particularly those involving harmful substances like PFAS.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Articles 1.7 of the Omgevingswet and 9.2.1.2 of the Wet milieubeheer require preventive measures when harm is foreseeable. This is rooted in the precautionary principle and places the burden on companies to act in anticipation of risk.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
            <h3>3. Remediate</h3>
            <p>If environmental harm has occurred,<b> those responsible are required to remediate the damage.</b> This is not optional—it is a binding component of the duty of care.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Remediation duties stem from both statutory law and evolving jurisprudence. Even in the absence of explicit regulation, courts have affirmed that the general duty of care applies. This is particularly relevant in transnational issues like PFAS, where regulation may lag behind. Theoretically, duty of care fills regulatory gaps to ensure environmental protection remains enforceable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
            <h3>4. Monitor</h3>
            <p><b>Duty of care is not static.</b> Businesses must continuously monitor their processes and risks to remain compliant with evolving legal standards and scientific knowledge.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Monitoring obligations are supported by frameworks such as the EU Water Framework Directive. These require companies to keep pace with new scientific insights, particularly in relation to substances like PFAS. Legal scholars argue that this reflects a dynamic regulatory environment where actors are expected to adapt based on up-to-date knowledge and not wait for prescriptive rules.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
            <h3>5. Report</h3>
            <p><b>Transparency is essential.</b> Companies must clearly report on risks, actions taken, and their results. This duty is not only strategic but increasingly enforceable.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal Context:</strong> Under regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), companies are obligated to publicly disclose environmental and human rights impacts. Beyond compliance, legal philosophy underscores that public reporting facilitates democratic discourse and accountability—ensuring duty of care is not just private intent but publicly assessable practice.</p>

                <h3>Important Note:</h3>
                <p>The answer is always <b>YES</b>, until you stop using PFAS completely!</p>
                <p>Even if your company has not yet encountered legal claims or public scrutiny over PFAS, the risk is real and growing.</p>
                <p class="legal-text">This is where duty of care becomes critical. In legal terms, duty of care is the responsibility an organization holds to prevent foreseeable harm. Courts are increasingly recognizing that companies must not only respond to known risks, but also anticipate and mitigate emerging threats — especially those with mounting scientific, regulatory, and societal concern, like PFAS.</p>
                <p class="consequences">If your company fails to act despite mounting evidence — or continues using PFAS without exploring safer alternatives — it may be argued that you breached your duty of care. This breach can form the basis for:</p>
                <ul class="consequences-list">
                    <li>Lawsuits from customers, employees, or downstream businesses</li>
                    <li>Product recalls or bans under expanding chemical safety laws</li>
                    <li>Damage to brand trust, shareholder confidence, and customer loyalty</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="final-note">Even companies that did not intentionally cause harm can be held liable if they ignored clear warnings or failed to pursue reasonable precautions. Courts and regulators ask:</p>
                <blockquote>"Did the company take steps that a reasonable organization in its position <b>should</b> have taken?"</blockquote>
                <p class="action-note">By taking even small steps now — such as evaluating PFAS use, exploring alternatives, or engaging suppliers — your company demonstrates proactive care and responsible governance. This not only reduces legal exposure but strengthens your standing with customers, investors, and regulators alike.</p>
                <p class="warning">Inaction IS negligence.</p>

                        <p>Even if your company has not yet encountered legal claims or public scrutiny over PFAS, the risk is real and growing.</p>

                        <h5><b>Going PFAS-Free: A Strategic Business Move That Reshapes Industry Norms</b></h5>
                        <p>Phasing out PFAS is not just a compliance or environmental issue — it is a strategic business decision with far-reaching implications. By demonstrating that your company can reduce or eliminate PFAS while maintaining quality, profitability, and innovation, you position yourself as a leader in responsible industry practice.</p>
                        
                        <p>Importantly, this leadership creates legal and market leverage:</p>
                        <ul class="strategy-list">
                            <li>You set the benchmark for what is “reasonably possible.” Courts and regulators use the actions of peers to determine whether a company has met its duty of care. If your organization proves it is possible to operate with less or no PFAS, you raise the bar across the sector. Competitors who continue business as usual may no longer claim that phasing out PFAS is infeasible — because you’ve shown it can be done.</li>
                            <li>You shape the narrative of accountability. Public perception and legal risk increasingly center on which companies took initiative — and which waited to be forced. Early action strengthens your credibility and reduces your exposure to lawsuits, reputational damage, or investor withdrawal.</li>
                            <li>You build trust with customers, employees, and regulators. A proactive PFAS strategy shows that your company is not merely reacting to crisis, but thinking ahead. This empowers stakeholders to align with your brand, knowing they are choosing safety, sustainability, and leadership.</li>
                            <li>You gain early access to growing PFAS-free markets. As more consumers, retailers, and governments set PFAS restrictions, demand is shifting. Companies that are prepared can capture market share, meet certifications, and unlock new partnerships where others lag behind.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>In short, eliminating PFAS isn't just about risk — it’s about competitive advantage. Your company's initiative doesn’t just protect your future — it helps shape what the future of your industry will be.</p>

            <p>Going PFAS-free proves what is possible.
