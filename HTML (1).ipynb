    "## HTML Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It is not a programming but a markup language to create the structure of a web page. The web page is displayed on your screen after HTML is interpreted by your browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge). HTML code is read from top to bottom and left to right. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complete HTML is composed of a set of **element**s. Elements can be nested inside of other elements. An element looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <tagname> content </tagname>\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTML element starts with an **opening tag**, then includes some **content**, and ends with a **closing tag**. **Tag** is a keyword used to define the type of structure that the *content* should have. Notice that the tag name is used within `<>` brackets, and a closing tag must start with a `/` to indicate that it is a closing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some fundamental tag types are listed here:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Tag Type  |Function                 | \n",
    "|----------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|<!DOCTYPE>|Defines the document type|\n",
    "|\\<html>   |Defines an HTML content |\n",
    "|\\<head>   |Contains meta information of the HTML page|\n",
    "|\\<title>  |Defines a title for the document which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab|\n",
    "|\\<body>   |Defines the document's body to be displayed on the web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables etc.|\n",
    "|\\<div>    |Defines a seperate section in the page|\n",
    "|\\<h1> ... \\<h6> |Defines large headings, from largest with \\<h1> to smallest with \\<h6>|\n",
    "|\\<p>      |Defines a paragraph|\n",
    "|\\<a>      |Defines a hyperlink|\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tag types used for (very basic) styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Tag Type  |Function                 | \n",
    "|----------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|\\<b>      |Makes the content text bold|\n",
    "|\\<i>      |Makes the content text italic|\n",
    "|\\<u>      |Underlines the content text|\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to display \"Hello, world!\" on your web page, the HTML structure will include the following element in its *body*:\n",
    "\n",
    "        <body> Hello, world! </body>\n",
    "        \n",
    "- If you want to write this text in bold, then there will be a nested second element as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "        <body> <b> Hello, world! </b> </body>\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Some elements do not need a closing tag; they are used only with an opening tag. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Tag Type  |Function                 | \n",
    "|----------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|\\<br>     |Breaks a line|\n",
    "|\\<hr>     |Draws a horizontal line across the webpage|\n",
    "|\\<img>    |Adds an image|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** HTML has too many tag options to list here. You can always google to find/remember what you need in HTML. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a good resource to find and learn options for HTML (and CSS). "

    "We have created a web page that displays information to the user but does not receive any input from the user. Depending on your purpose, you may want to create an interactive page and collect information from the user. One of the HTML options for adding interaction is the **form** element. Form element displays an input field on the page which can have various formats, e.g. a blank space to type a text, a selection option from a drop-down menu, a button to submit, etc. A form element requires a nested element structure like a table element.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some tags used to create forms are listed in the table below. Among these, only the `<input>` element does not require a closing tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "|Tag Type  |Function                 | \n",
    "|----------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|\\<form>   |Defines a form|\n",
    "|\\<input>  |Creates an input field|\n",
    "|\\<label>  |Adds a label to the input field|\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<input>` tag has several important attributes. The first one is the `type` attribute which is to define the type of input. It can take many different values and each option displays a different input format on the screen. Some of them are listed here:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Values of `type` Attribute  |Function                 | \n",
    "|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "|\\\"text\"      |Creates a text field (it is the default value)|\n",
    "|\\\"number\"    |Creates a field for a number|\n",
    "|\\\"password\"  |Creates a password field while showing hidden characters on the screen|\n",
    "|\\\"email\"     |Creates a field for an email address|\n",
    "|\\\"date\"      |Creates a clickable calendar to select a date|\n",
    "|\\\"radio\"     |Creates a radio button|\n",
    "|\\\"checkbox\"  |Creates a checkbox|\n",
    "|\\\"submit\"    |Creates a clickable submit button|\n",
    "|\\\"image\"     |Creates a clickable submit button with an image|\n",
    "\n",
    "Another attribute of `<input>` is the `name`. It is used as a reference name for the corresponding input value while the input value is processed after submitting the form. We will register the input value with this name in our memory (i.e. database) and be able to track it. We will come back to the database topic later... \n",
    "\n",
    "`id` attribute of `<input>` holds a *unique* identifier value for the element. It is useful while, for example, using the `<label>` tag to display a label for the input field. `for` is an attribute of the `<label>` to link the label with an input. An example will make this clearer...\n",
